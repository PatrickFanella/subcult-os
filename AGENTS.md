# Agent Instructions

This repository is `subcult-os`, a Go full-stack project with Vite React TypeScript, Postgres, and Docker, bootstrapped from `subculture-collective/project-template`.

## Priorities

1. Keep the project runnable and minimal.
2. Preserve Open Pilot issue and PR templates.
3. Keep generated caches, secrets, and local data out of git.
4. Update this file and `README.md` when stack conventions change.

Use the Subcults terminal design system in `docs/design-system.md`.
Edit `contracts/design/tokens.json`, then run `node scripts/design-tokens.mjs`;
do not edit generated client tokens independently. Prefer semantic colors and
shared controls. Keep event artwork and scanner surfaces immersive.
Brand assets in `web/public/` and the app icons in `mobile/assets/` come from the
`subcult-studio` Subcult OS pack.
Change the mark in Studio, then re-export with `python3 scripts/brand-assets.py
--studio-root <checkout>`; do not edit the exported files or
`docs/brand-provenance.json` by hand.

The optional `atproto-workers` Compose profile runs the revocation command from the same API image against the shared database. Keep it opt-in, run migrations before processing, and preserve secret-free status/error output. It may drain existing revocations even when new OAuth links are disabled.

The optional `mail-workers` profile runs `email-deliver -send -watch`. Sending additionally requires `MAIL_DELIVERY_ENABLED=true`, configured provider credentials and approved sender settings. Old/development outbox rows remain held. The default `email-deliver` command prints aggregate status only; never send live messages during automated qualification.

Resend feedback requires `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Brevo feedback requires bearer authentication with `BREVO_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`; enabled sending requires the selected provider's feedback secret. Select Brevo with `MAIL_PROVIDER=brevo` and configure `BREVO_API_KEY`. Keep signature checks on raw bytes and recipient suppression independent of webhook-supplied addresses. Feedback may continue while sending is disabled. Never roll back to a worker without suppression enforcement while sending remains enabled.

The optional `atproto-projection` profile runs `atproto-project -run`, an allowlisted, restart-safe mirror of the three admitted `tv.subcult.*` collections read from an external Jetstream-shaped stream (see `docs/development/projection.md`). Running it requires `AT_PROJECTION_ENABLED=true` and `AT_PROJECTION_SOURCE_URL`. It only ever writes to `at_projection_*` tables; never point it at the `cultural_*` tables or treat its output as authorized for publication.

The optional `announcement-workers` profile runs `email-deliver -announce -watch` (see `docs/development/announcements.md`, SIGNAL-01). It only claims due scheduled announcements and enqueues their recipient `email_outbox` rows from the existing `consent_grants` audience, minus suppression; it never contacts the mail provider and does not require `MAIL_DELIVERY_ENABLED`. Actual sending of the rows it enqueues still goes through the `mail-workers` profile and remains subject to `MAIL_DELIVERY_ENABLED`. Email remains the only implemented announcement channel; do not add an SMS or other provider without a documented pilot need and cost basis.

## Verification

For isolated T3 development, use `bash scripts/dev-env.sh start` and the printed
preview URL. `seed` creates synthetic demo data through normal signup/verification;
`watch` restarts the backend on edits. `stop` removes the worktree's containers and
network and retains its data volumes.
Use `bash scripts/dev-env.sh verify` to run the required verification and a
separate disposable DB gate with pinned toolchains. Never substitute the dev
database for the disposable test database. The repository disposable test DB
has a 1 GiB cap for the complete migration suite; keep it separate from the
retained development database and from the installed shared T3 recipe.
The standalone `compose.dev.yml`
must not be merged with deployment Compose files or given production credentials.

Run:

```bash
make verify
```

Use narrower commands only when an issue explicitly asks for a smaller check.

Gitea CI provisions Node 24, pnpm 10.33.0 and Go 1.26.6 in the job rather than
assuming the shared runner image includes them. Keep toolchain changes explicit
and distinguish local `make verify` from the actual hosted result.
The workflow runs the complete `make test-db` gate against its disposable
PostgreSQL service. Never point that gate at a retained application database.

## Cloned Dependency Source

Read-only dependency source repositories are available under
`.blacktower/clonedeps/repos/` for inspection. Do not edit these clones.

- `.blacktower/clonedeps/repos/bluesky-social__indigo/` — `bluesky-social/indigo` at `41278964ec8e3253e70d4e919dfb8e34211c543d`; use it to inspect the pinned unstable AT Protocol syntax and OAuth implementation.
